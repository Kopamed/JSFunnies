Some funnies for ghost website modifications


## How do I add a script to Tampermonkey?
1. Go to the folder of the script you want to install. In my case I will be installing the Github Avatar Magnifier.
2. Once in the folder, look for the name of the script with _tampermonkey at the end and click on it. You should now be looking at this.<br>

4. Now copy `ctrl+a` and then `ctrl+c` the code.
5. Get tampermonkey for your browser by searching up "tampermonkey" in your browser and installing it. An icon should appear in the top right corner of the browser<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mmTYh9s.png"><br>
6. Click on the icon and click `create new script` <br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4Mc4Ome.png"><br>
7. Now paste `ctrl+v` the code into the text box and save the script `ctrl+s`
8. The script is now ready to be used! A number should light up above the icon when visiting a website where a script is used: <br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/n2zCl44.png">


## How do I use the normal scripts (without the _tampermonkey in the filename)?
1. Go to the folder of the script you want to use. In my case I will be using the Random Image Replacer.
2. Once in the folder, look for the name of the script without _tampermonkey at the end and click on it. You should now be looking at this.<br>

4. Now copy `ctrl+a` and then `ctrl+c` the code.
5. Go to the website you want to use this on. In my case I will go to https://linuxmint.com/ 
6. Now open the console by pressing f12 or `ctrl+shift+i`
7. Go to this part of the console: <br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bE0PDLc.png"><br>
8. Paste the copied code into the console, press enter and watch the magic take place! <br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ubhiBry.png">

## New errors and already known errors
**Before opening an issue, please read the already known errors listed below**<br>
I will hopefully fix all the known issues pretty soon.<br>
Known issues:
 - Avatars in commit lists on github are not resized
 - Some site's images are not changed. This is hard to fix as it sometimes breaks the website

 Opening a new issue:
 Just follow the default issue report layout lmao
